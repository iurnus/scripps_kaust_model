ESMF-MITgcm interface test

This case aims to test the implementation of ESMF-MITgcm interface. In this
test, ESMF drives MITgcm for its "init", "run", "finalize". The ESMF-atmosphere
interface is also implemented but not used.

This test uses 1 CPU.

simulation:
  California region
  The results should be the same as stand-alone MITgcm code

To install and run this case::

./install.sh
cd mitRun
./Allrun

To clean this case::

./clean.sh

Folders:
  ./mitRun: The simulation will run in this folder.
  ./mitCode: A few updates of MITgcm source code.
  ./utils: Install scripts for MITgcm.
