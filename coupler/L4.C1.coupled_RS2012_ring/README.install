MITgcm-WRF coupled simulation test: Red Sea

This folder contains an MITgcm-WRF coupled test case. The coupled simulation is
driven by ESMF. The case aims to test the implementation of the coupled code.
In this test, the ESMF driver drives both MITgcm and WRF. Both MITgcm and WRF
are divided into "init", "run", "finalize" parts. This coupled code drives the
realistic simulations in the Red Sea region.

The WRF bulf formula is used in this case.
This should be compiled using PGI compiler (run it on ring).

simulation:
  Red Sea region

Notes:
To install and run this case::

./install.sh
cd runCase.init
./Allrun
cd runCase
./Allrun

To clean this case::

./clean.sh

How to check if the code is installed?

MITGCM executable is: build/mitgcmuv
MITGCM library is: build/mmout/libmitgcm_org_ocn.a
MITGCM run time library is: build/mmout/libmitgcmrtl.a
MITGCM mod file is: build/mitgcm_org_ocn.mod
The coupled MITGCM-ESMF solver is: coupledCode/esmf_application

MUST run the coupled case first:

./allrun.sh

runMITtest: Test if the MITgcm flux is added correctly. (To install stand-alone MITgcm code, run ./install_mit.sh)
runWRFtest: Test if the WRF flux is added correctly
latexSummary: Generate the report automatically.

WARNING!!!WARNING!!!
####################
The MITgcm path is defined as '${HOME}/scripps_kaust_model_github/MITgcm_c67m' in install.sh
The MPI_HOME path is defined as '/project_shared/Libraries/openmpi-2.1.1_pgi_fortran_17.5-0/include' in install.sh

The ESMF should be installed to run this case. The variable ESMFMKFILE should
be defined:

  export ESMFMKFILE=$ESMF_DIR/lib/libg/Linux.pgi.64.openmpi.default/esmf.mk

where ESMF_DIR should be the location that ESMF is installed.

Make sure MATLAB is installed.
Make sure NCL is installed.
