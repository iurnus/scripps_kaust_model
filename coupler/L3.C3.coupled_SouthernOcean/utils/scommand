# sed command that makes remaining real variables (i.e. not _RL or _RS) real*8
# this is needed because mdsio_readfile() etc... abuse the types of the array
# passed over their interface. f90 compilers see the call and the interface
# within the same module at the moment and get upset.
#
# command reads "mitgcm_org_ocn_mod.F" and writes "foo.F"
#
# command is source'd from mkmod.sh
#
cat mitgcm_org_ocn_mod.F | sed s'/\(^ *\)[Rr][Ee][Aa][Ll]\( .*\)/\1REAL\*8\2/' > foo.F
