This folder contains an ESMF test case. The case aims to test the
implementation of ESMF driver. In this test, a prototype ESMF driver will run,
but the driver is not driving "real" ocean/atmosphere models.


To install and run this case::

To clean this case::

  ./clean.sh

Folders:

  ./coupledSolver: Source code for the ESMF test case
  ./run: The simulation will run in this folder.

The ESMF should be installed to run this case. The variable ESMFMKFILE should
be defined:

where ESMF_DIR should be the location that ESMF is installed.
